### The test task for the postion of Full Stack React Native/Node (MERN) developer
Todo: upgrade to angular 4

The repository contains two folders:
1) Native is the client app for iOS/Android built in React Native, Redux and two types of DBs
2) Photostore is the RESTful web server built on Node with Express framework with mLab cluster as a storage.
3) DS_Store is Mac OS X finder file (directory config)
4) The license

Note: the server is already deployed to Heroku so you can actually just run the client from the "native" folder

Also, I have tested the app only on iOS devices.
